My name is <b>Andrew O'Neill</b>, I am originally from Dublin, but am living in Gorey, Wexford. As of right now, I am a bartender in one of my local hotels and have been for a year now. I'm currently searching for a new job more focused on cocktails. I would love to work in a cocktail restaurant. There is an amazing one local to me called Raspberry, which I'd love to work in. In the middle, are three images that my manager took of cocktails I made, to show the new Bar staff what they should look like. At the start of my new job, I was very confused as I had no previous bar experience, but as I'm a keen and fast learner, I decided to make it my mission to learn cocktails as best I could. Now my manager has made Christmas themed cocktails available on the menu based on ideas that I have given him. the names of the ccoktails are: "Apple Pie", "Gingerbread Alexander", "The Grinch", "Santa Morgan", and the basic "Pink Gin Sangria".</p>

In my spare time, I enjoy playing games. My favouritee gamees are competitive shooters, like Valorant, and Rainbow Six Siege. Aside from that, I like learning new things, I thouroughly enjoy drawing, both digitally and on paper. I'm always trying to find ways to make money, I once sold my drawings for a commission. My first drawing sold for â‚¬40 on Depop. From there, I decided to work on commission rates, as that first sale seemed to have made me trigger-happy in a way. I have always had a keen passion for entrepreneurship. When I was just 12 years old, I noticed that both the iPhone 6, and 7's screens were constantly breaking, so I decided to learn how to fix them. It started with my dad's phone, which he was very skeptical about. I did a great job on it and he even decided to pay me for it. From there, I started to post advertisements on DoneDeal for iPhone 6/7 screen replacements, where I started to make a lot of money from. Furthermore, with that money, I would purchase broken iPhone 6/7's for very cheap, buy replacement parts for cheap, then fix and re-sell them.</p>
